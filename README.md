### Introduction
When you are a game developer and you want your games to be accessible on the web, you want speed to ensure the best possible experience for your end user. However, JavaScript isn't too fast and games can require complex calculations to be done quickly. This is where WebAssembly (**WASM**) comes into play. WASM is a fast language that can run in browsers and interops with JavaScript, but writing WASM in it's text form can be inefficient, and writing bindings can be even harder since you cannot directly access the Document Object Model (**DOM**). HeHeHeHa.CPP aims to streamline the process by using LLVM Clang to compile C++ to WASM. It has bindings for easy access to the canvas and is very fast because most of the work is done in the C++ rather than the JavaScript. HeHeHeHa.CPP is open to contributions and hopefully, it will grow and reach a larger audience. Good luck coding!
